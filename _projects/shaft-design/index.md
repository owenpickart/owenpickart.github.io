## Detailed Description
- Constructed free body, shear, moment, and torque diagrams for the input, counter, and output shafts of the speed reducer given module and speed ratio
- Determined minimum shaft diameters at locations of all gears and bearings through static force analysis (normal stress, torsional shear, transverse shear)
- Selected material for shafts based on strength, cost, and application
- Performed bending and gear tooth fatigue analysis to determine face width for gears and bearings with appropriate safety factor
