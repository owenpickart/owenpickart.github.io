## Detailed Description
- Constructed **free body, shear, moment, and torque diagrams** for the input, counter, and output shafts of the speed reducer given module and speed ratio
- Determined minimum shaft diameters at locations of all gears and bearings through **static force analysis**, analyzing normal, torsional shear, transverse shear and bending moment stresses
- **Selected materials** for shafts based on strength, cost, and application
- Performed **bending and gear tooth fatigue analysis** to determine face width for gears and bearings with appropriate safety factor
- Selected appropriate **bearings, snap rings, and shaft keys** based on determined face width, bore and safety factor
- Created **3D models and technical drawings** of input and counter shafts, focusing on lathe and mill manufacturability
