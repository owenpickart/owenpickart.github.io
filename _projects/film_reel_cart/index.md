## Detailed Description
- **Created model and technical drawings** of existing film reel cart using **Creo Parametric**
- **Observed** cart in use by operators, **identified** and **communicated potential design improvements** to engineering team
- **Realized design changes in model**, including a arc-shaped bed for the film and redesign of the frame resulting in:
  1. **Elimination** of film damage as a result of contact stress
  2. Ability for film to be slid on and off cart, **improving ergonomics**
  3. A **simplified** frame with more **efficient material usage**
- **Communicated** drawings with fabricators, receiving a quote for its contruction
- Redesigned film cart is **currently in use** in a food manufacturing facility
