- **Realized design changes in model**, including a arc-shaped bed for the film and redesign of the support resulting in:
  1. **elimination** of film damage as a result of contact stress
  2. the film reel able to slide onto the cart from the side **improving the ergonomic capabilities** of the cart
  3. a **simplified** frame with more **efficient material usage**
