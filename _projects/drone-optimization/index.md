## Detailed Description
- Simulated VM stress and displacement on original frame using **SolidWorks FEA** to identify stress concentrations in two test cases
- Conducted a **topology study** using **SolidWorks** to identify areas of the frame that could be removed whilst maintaining required strength
- Created a preliminary design focused on weight reduction in areas with low concentration as well as injection molding machinability
- Conducted a **design study** to adjust various dimensions on the frame to ensure maximum mass reduction while staying below required stress threshold
- Ensured resulting frame from design study had adequate stress levels through **SolidWorks FEA**
- Final optimized design resulted in a **55.4% reduction in mass**
- Created technical drawing of final optimized design using **SolidWorks**
