## Detailed Description
- Simulated stress and displacement on original frame using **SolidWorks FEA** to identify stress concentrations in hover and lift test cases
- Conducted a **topology study** using **SolidWorks FEA** to identify low-stress areas of the frame suitable for material removal
- **Designed a revised frame** by removing areas of the frame with low stress conectration while maintaining **injection molding machinability**
- Conducted a **design study** to iterate various dimensions on the frame, ensuring maximum mass reduction while maintaining required stress and displacement thresholds
- Obtained final design for drone frame resulting in a **55.4% reduction of overall mass** while maintaining structural integrity
- Created technical drawing of final optimized design using **SolidWorks**
